## Purpose

While the goal is for players of the game to have fun, the real purpose of this game is to:

1. Demonstrate how market forces around supply and demand in a closed system change outcomes for both human players and AI agents.
2. Use AI and possibly some ML to add controls into economy for the purpose of adding real time adjustments to market conditions based
on player actions.
3. Aggregate data from all players causing impacts to the economy in the entire game, globally and visable to all players.

# AI

Long term goal is to incorporate AI to interact in the markets, both for single and multi-player modes, to help keep the market changing in realistic patterns.

## AI & Markets

Markets are now data driven with data from all participating players used to create realistic pricing models.  The models are consumed by all
players to create their local economy.

The AI resides server side and not in the game therefore requiring players to agree to contribution anonymized market data from their game play.
